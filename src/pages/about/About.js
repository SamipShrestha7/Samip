        Components of a Road Safety System:
      </h2>
      <ol className="list-decimal ml-8 mb-8">
        <li className="mb-4">
          Traffic Monitoring: The system utilizes various sensors, such as loop
          detectors, cameras, and radar, to gather real-time data on traffic
          flow, volume, speed, and occupancy. This information is crucial for
          assessing the current state of the road network and making informed
          decisions.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          Traffic Control: Road Safety systems employ a range of control
          measures to regulate traffic flow. This includes traffic signals,
          variable message signs (VMS), ramp meters, and road signs. These
          devices can be manually or automatically controlled based on the
          traffic conditions.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          Incident Detection and Management: The system incorporates mechanisms
          to detect and respond to incidents on the road network promptly. This
          includes accidents, breakdowns, or any other events that can disrupt
          traffic flow. Timely detection and appropriate management of incidents
          help minimize their impact on overall traffic.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS): ITS technologies are often
          integrated into traffic management systems. These may include advanced
          data analytics, predictive modeling, and communication systems to
          provide accurate traffic predictions, optimize signal timing, and
          coordinate responses to incidents.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          Traveler Information Systems: Traffic management systems aim to
          provide real-time information to road users. This can be achieved
          through various channels such as dynamic message signs, mobile
          applications, websites, and radio broadcasts. By keeping travelers
          informed about traffic conditions, alternative routes, and estimated
          travel times, congestion can be reduced and driver decision-making can
          be improved.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          Central Control Center: A central control center serves as the nerve
          center of the traffic management system. It is staffed by operators
          who monitor the traffic conditions, receive incident reports, and make
          decisions regarding traffic control and management strategies. The
          control center integrates data from various sources, allowing
          operators to have a comprehensive view of the road network and take
          appropriate actions.

        Benefits of Traffic Management Systems:
      </h2>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-8 mb-8">
        <li className="mb-4">
          Improved Traffic Flow: By dynamically adjusting signal timings,
          managing incidents efficiently, and optimizing lane configurations,
          traffic management systems help to reduce congestion and improve the
          overall flow of vehicles.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          Increased Safety: Real-time monitoring and incident management
          contribute to enhanced road safety. Quick response to accidents or
          other emergencies can reduce the risk of secondary incidents and help
          emergency services reach the scene faster.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          Reduced Travel Time: With accurate information about traffic
          conditions and alternative routes, travelers can make informed
          decisions to avoid congested areas, resulting in shorter travel times
          and reduced frustration.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
          Environmental Benefits: Effective traffic management systems can lead
          to reduced fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by minimizing
          stop-and-go traffic and optimizing traffic flow.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-4">
